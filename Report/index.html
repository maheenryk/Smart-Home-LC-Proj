            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              According to GlobalData1, the smart home market was worth $35.9bn
              in 2020 and will grow to $75.3bn by 2025.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              A smart home is a home that incorporates automation systems to
              provide home owners with added security, convenience and energy
              efficiency. Smart homes make use of embedded system devices, also
              known as home automation devices, which enable home owners to
              monitor and/or manage domestic appliances and systems through
              remote web applications or some other networked device.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              Ultimately, smart homes are about making living spaces more
              enjoyable, secure and convenient for home owners through the use
              of automation to enhance the building’s functions. For example,
              smart home systems may be used to control lighting, temperature,
              multi‐media, air quality, grant or deny home access through smart
              locks, window and door operation, check in on security cameras and
              even automate feeding pets as well as many other functions.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              Some of the areas where home automation systems are used are shown
              in the illustration below.

            <p class="lead">
              <u>The Task</u>
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              For this project you are required to design and develop:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                An interactive website on behalf of a fictional home automation
                company.
              </li>
              <li>
                An embedded system that could be used as part of a home
                automation system.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p class="lead">
              The basic and advanced requirements for both the website and the
              embedded system are set out as follows:
            </p>

            <br />

            <p class="lead">
              <u>Basic Requirements</u>
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              The basic requirement is to create both a website and a
              stand‐alone home automation embedded system. You must decide on
              the exact requirements for both the website and the embedded
              system. These requirements should address some specific problem or
              set of user needs as identified by the owner of the company
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              <i><b>Website</b></i>
              <br />
              The website should be created to meet the needs of the owner of a
              fictional company that has recently entered into the home
              automation business. The type of business can be of your own
              choosing and you can decide on its name, as well as the range of
              services and/or products it specialises in.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              Specifically, the basic requirements are to incorporate the
              following front‐end features into a working website:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                A minimum of four separate pages, including a home page and a
                user‐friendly navigation system. You should dedicate one of the
                pages to highlight the main issue addressed by your embedded
                system as well as its main features.
              </li>
              <li>
                A clean, crisp, consistent visual design with clearly defined
                regions and well formatted content that is informative, concise
                and easy to read.
              </li>
              <li>
                The use of a combination of headings, paragraphs, lists, tables,
                links, images and multimedia elements such as video, sound and
                animation.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="lead">
              Accessibility should be a consideration in the design of your
              website. An accessible website is one that is usable by all people
              to the greatest extent possible without the need for adaptation.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              The website must comply with the school’s Acceptable Usage Policy
              and with GDPR. In particular, the content should not contain any
              information that would enable you to be identified.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              <i><b>Embedded System</b></i>
              <br />
              For the basic requirements the embedded system can be implemented
              as a standalone device i.e. remote operation is not a requirement.
              However, once started (manually) the system should operate
              automatically or with minimal user intervention.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              In simple smart home scenarios, events can be timed or triggered
              locally. Timed events are based on a clock, for example lowering
              the blinds at 6pm, while triggered events depend on actions in the
              automated system; some examples are:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                When a room gets too hot the air conditioning is automatically
                switched on.
              </li>
              <li>
                When a home owner approaches their own front door it
                automatically unlocks and the lights go on.
              </li>
              <li>
                When the level of carbon monoxide exceeds a certain level, an
                alarm is triggered.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="lead">
              Finally, you should note that neither data capture nor storage are
              required to fulfil the basic requirements.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              <u>Advanced Requirements</u>
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              In more sophisticated home automation systems home owners can
              control and monitor their homes remotely via web applications or
              some other networked device.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              For the advanced requirements you are required to extend and
              integrate the website and embedded system so that the website can
              be used to control and/or monitor the home automation embedded
              system.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              Specifically, for the advanced requirement you are required to:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Make any changes necessary to the artefacts created for the
                basic requirements so that they can operate as part of a single
                system.
              </li>
              <li>
                Add one or more data capture forms to your basic website. While
                you can decide on the exact purpose of the form(s) and the
                nature and type of the data they are used to collect, you should
                ensure to include a variety of different user interface controls
                such as labels, text boxes/scrolling text areas, push buttons,
                radio buttons, check boxes, drop down lists, sliders, spinners,
                calendars and similar
              </li>

              thoroughly before I attempted to fix anything and made sure I
              documented each issue that arose along with each solution that I
              thought of for it.

              In order to start developing the artefact, I had to conduct some
              research on how an ID card system would even function using
              MicroBits. I had the idea that the project would definitely run
              through radio signals, so to begin my research, I went to the
              official BBC MicroBit website and looked up projects relating to
              radio signal transmitting and receiving. I found quite good
              tutorials for building transmitters as well as proximity beacons.

              This project has been built to function as a potential embedded
              system to act as a smart home device. The MicroBits act as ID
              cards for users and allow them to register swiftly with the
              house’s MicroBits. Both the user and the home’s MicroBits are
              embedded with their own ID which allows Python to recognise and
              compare the IDs with the information in the database. For this to
              work properly, I needed to build relational databases. I ended up
              having two relational databases, “Rooms” and “Users” (refer to
              Fig. 6).

              The MicroBit sends the user ID to Firebase, along with the ID of
              the room, and both these pieces of string are compared with the
              Index and ID of the existing room and user data. Python then
              accesses the database and matches the IDs to their corresponding
              information. After the information of the ID has been received,
              Python then sends the user’s information back with a time stamp
              and the room they entered to a separate database called “Registry”
              (refer to Fig. 7).

            <p class="lead">
              The IDs could be used alongside a MicroBit connected to the lock
              in doors, so as anyone registered with the house approaches, the
              door automatically unlocks and lets the user in, while also
              displaying the exact time in which they entered. The Python code
              also uses the MicroBit to evaluate whether the temperature is at
              or above a certain level, and if it is, the air conditioning
              status is switched to on.

            <p class="lead">
              This data is stored in Firebase and is accessible from the second
              Python file. This file allows the user to create and view data
              from Firebase (refer to Fig.8). When the program is launched, the
              user will have six options: To write a new user, to write a new
              room, to read the registry, to read the list of users, to read the
              list of rooms and to terminate the program. This is a very
              efficient way to view data stored in Firebase using the input of
              just a single digit that determines which option you wish to
              navigate.

              One of the problems I encountered while building the code was the
              registration of the users as their MicroBit sent the data to the
              main MicroBit. Since my original code looked like this:
            </p>

                Fig. 11 - Python Code for Registering Users
              </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p class="lead">
              What was happening was that Python was drawing existing data from
              the registry to obtain the information regarding each ID number
              and uploading it back with the new data, and this was creating
              duplicates. This was obviously a very annoying problem as it
              caused multiples of the same data, clogging up the database. Now
              that I had the problem identified though, I tried to come up with
              a few possible solutions that would solve this issue. These
              solutions were:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                Find a way to delete or clear a registry within Firebase using
                Python. The registry would be cleared before each upload.
              </li>
              <li>
                Discover a different method of uploading the data using a
                different system.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p class="lead">
              When I attempted to implement the first solution, I hit a dead
              end. I could not execute a suitable block of code within my code
              that would allow me to delete a registry from Python, and this
              method would have proven to be extremely tedious and unnecessarily
              energy consuming as when dealing with large amounts of data, the
              code may crash due to mass deleting and uploading data all at
              once.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              The second solution proved to be much more fruitful. During this
              stage of the iteration, instead of using the automatically
              assigned index from Firebase as data is uploaded, I chose to give
              each user their own index number to be uploaded to Firebase along
              with the rest of their data. This would allow python to scan the
              specific index key for the users and pull their information from
              that index position. Fig. 12 shows what the code looked like after
              the solution was incorporated into it.

              Not only did I find that the program ran much more smoothly, I
              also found that it took up less lines and was much more compact
              and efficient. Whereas before, the MicroBit would have sent an ID
              number along the lines of “HJ2405” now it would send one
              resembling “HJ24059”, where the last number, in this case 9, would
              represent the index of the user.

              I also had multiple files for performing different functions.

              I decided that the other files that were performing functions such
              as reading data and writing data, would all be one file with
              callable functions that the user, would be able to call and use to
              change or update the data.

            <p class="lead">
              This not only improved the functionality of the programs
              immensely, it also allowed me to design a visually pleasing
              interface for the users that would be accessible and easy to
              maneuver, as shown in Fig. 8.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              As I started to develop the MicroBit code, I encountered a
              problem. The user’s MicroBit could send a signal across a great
              range, but this meant that the student’s MicroBit could be
              registered to multiple rooms at once. This was due to the lack of
              proximity limits for the MicroBits, and to solve this I had to
              research how the radio range actually worked. The radio range for
              the MicroBits can span as far as 70 meters<a
                href="https://makecode.microbit.org/reference/radio/set-transmit-power"
                ><sup>[2]</sup></a
              >. This is at the strongest transmitting power of 7. So in order
              to limit the range and to make sure only the MicroBits near the
              room’s MicroBit got registered, I limited the transmit power to 1
              and decided that the room’s MicroBit would only accept the signal
              if it was greater than -80. This meant that the user’s MicroBit
              would have to be extremely close to give a signal strong enough to
              be registered.

              <span>3.2 Testing of the Artefact</span>
            </h1>

            <p class="lead">
              I tested the artefact using both white box and black box testing<a
                href="https://www.grandmetric.com/2021/03/11/blackbox-whitebox-testing/"
                ><sup>[3]</sup></a
              >
              since the system is designed to be utilized by homes and normal
              people who may not be the most computer literate. Since black box
              testing requires testers who have no clue about the inner workings
              of the code, I gave the system for testing to my father, who was
              still able to maneuver and use the program. He did find different
              bugs within the system which I wouldn’t have found as the
              developer, this was really helpful in making the system more
              accessible and functional for users.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              For white box testing, I requested a classmate to try out the
              system and locate faults within it. Since they were also
              well-versed in computers, they were able to pinpoint the defects
              and what caused them. The testing time for the MicroBits took the
              most time. Sometimes the data sent from the MicroBit would have
              several unnecessary symbols and letters that hindered the process.
              To solve this, I researched how to isolate a select section of a
              string and incorporate that code into my python file. The
              MicroBits also required a thorough testing of the range and I had
              to really pinpoint what the ideal range should be.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              I had a few issues with the JavaScript and the HTML code as well,
              but most were resolved with a bit of research. Many were issues
              with misspelling which I was able to correct quickly.

            <p class="lead">
              I firmly believe the project achieved the design ambitions to as
              fulfilling of an extent as possible. The MicroBits are capable of
              effectively storing and communicating data, acting as both ID
              cards and embedded systems. The Python code allows the MicroBit
              data to be compared alongside data pulled from Firebase, then
              sorted, analysed and uploaded onto Firebase. When each user
              registers, Python displays their name, ID, location, and time of
              registration for an easy and readable display of information,
              alongside a frequent transmission of temperatures within the
              rooms.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              Python is also able to create and manage relational databases
              using Firebase which helps in gathering the correct data in
              regards to the locations of the users. This ensures that data
              stored on the MicroBits is not risking the privacy and security of
              each individual as the information behind each ID number is solely
              stored on Firebase.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              This system meets the end user needs by being visually accessible
              and informative. The website is easily navigated and contains
              useful information, as well as an aesthetic layout. Users will be
              able to easily access and understand the information being
              communicated. This could prove to be a promising method of
              controlling and managing your home.
            </p>

              <span>4.2 Future Development of the Artefact</span>
            </h1>

            <p class="lead">
              Future expansion of this artefact could lead to an automated smart
              home system within not only homes, but also the likes of hotels,
              offices etc. For example, if each building has a smart system
              embedded within, the building can more effectively utilise their
              time and energy e.g., if a room is empty then the system would
              automatically turn off air conditioning and lights if they are on.
              People can also monitor the state of their building and toggle on
              lights etc. ahead of their arrival. This would be beneficial to
              the energy efficiency of buildings and reduce costs.
